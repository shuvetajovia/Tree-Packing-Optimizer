# Tree-Packing-Optimizer
The system uses a RandomForest model to predict optimal tree rotation from the number of trees. Trees are modeled as polygons and placed using geometric heuristics with overlap detection. The best layout minimizes the bounding square and is visualized on canvas with tabular details.
